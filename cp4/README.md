This repository contains solutions to the exercises found in the book,
[Competitive Programming](https://cpbook.net), written by Felix Halim, Steven
Halim, and Suhendry Effendy.  The intent behind sharing these solutions is to
assist other competitive programmers in understanding different approaches to
solving problems.  Please note that these solutions are intended for educational
purposes and should not be used for cheating.
