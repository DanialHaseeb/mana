# ðŸ¦€ Rust

This repository contains solutions to the Rust exercises from
[exercism.org](https://exercism.org/tracks/rust/exercises).  Exercism provides a
collection of coding exercises for various programming languages, including
Rust, to help developers practice and improve their skills.

## Structure

Each exercise is represented by a separate folder within the repository.
These folders correspond to individual Cargo projects and contain the
following files and directories:
* `src/`:
	Directory containing the source code files for the exercise.
* `tests/`:
	Directory containing the test suite for the exercise.
* `README.md`:
	Markdown file containing the exercise description and instructions.
* Additionally, some exercises may contain a `Cargo.toml` file. This file
	contains metadata about the Cargo project and is not directly related to the
	exercise.

## Contributing
