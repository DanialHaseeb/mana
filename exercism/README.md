# { } Exercism

Welcome to the Exercism-specific folder within the `mana` repository! Here,
you will find a curated selection of exercises and their corresponding solutions
that I have completed on [Exercism](https://exercism.org/).  The challenges
range from beginner to advanced and cover a multitude of topics, including
algorithms, data structures, and language-specific idioms.

## Languages

I primarily used it to start practicing Rust, but I hope to add more languages
soon.

## Usage

Feel free to browse through the exercises, run the code, or even submit your own
solutions if you're tackling the same challenges on Exercism.  These are not
only solutions but also learning resources.

## Feedback and Contributions

If you spot an error or have suggestions for improvement, please open an issue
or submit a pull request.  Your feedback is always welcome!

## Acknowledgements
