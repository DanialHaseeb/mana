# üêà Kattis

Welcome to the Kattis-specific folder within the `mana` repository! Here,
you will find a selection of exercises and their corresponding solutions
that I have completed on [Kattis][kattis].  The challenges
range from beginner to advanced and cover a multitude of topics, including
algorithms, data structures, and language-specific idioms.

## Languages

C++ is by far the most highly recommended language to use on competitive
programming platforms, so that is what I chose to use here too.

# Structure

Each problem is represented by a separate folder within the repository and
contain the following files:
* Source file:
	Usually `main.cpp`; containing the source code of the solution.
* `README.md`:
	Markdown file containing the problem description and sample inputs / outputs.

## Usage

Feel free to browse through the exercises, run the code, or even submit your own
solutions if you're tackling the same challenges on Kattis.  These are not
only solutions but also learning resources.

## Contributing

If you have alternative solutions, improvements, or new exercises to add,
contributions are welcome!

## Disclaimer

The solutions provided in this repository are for practice purposes and may not
be the most optimal or efficient solutions.

## Acknowledgements

Special thanks to [Kattis][kattis] for providing a platform that
offers high-quality coding exercises to improve programming skills.
