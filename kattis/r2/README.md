# [R2](https://open.kattis.com/problems/r2)

The number $S$ is called the mean of two numbers, $R_1$ and $R_2$, if $S$ is
equal to $\frac{R_1 + R_2}{2}$.  Mirkoâ€™s birthday present for Slavko was two
integers $R_1$ and $R_2$.  Slavko promptly calculated their mean which also
happened to be an integer but then lost $R_2$!  Help Slavko restore $R_2$.

## Input

The first and only line of input contains two integers $R_1$ and $S$, both
between $-1\,000$ and $1\,000$.

## Output

Output $R_2$ on a single line.
