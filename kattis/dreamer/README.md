Bash just woke up from his sweetest dream ever.  In his dream, he became the
best Pokenom trainer---like no one ever was.  It was on the dateâ€¦

Unfortunately, Bash forgot the exact date.  He only remembered that the date was
written in format `DD MM YYYY` with exactly $8$ digits.  He also remembers these
$8$ digits (but he does not remember their order).  Of course, the date must be
a valid date.

Since Bash was born on January 1<sup>st</sup>, 2000, he knows that the date was
on or after January 1<sup>st</sup>, 2000. (Note that the date can be January
1<sup>st</sup>, 2000---it means Bash is destined to be the best Pokemon trainer
since he was born!).

Bash really wants to know the date when he become the best Pokenom trainer.  How
many possible valid dates could there be?  What is the earliest valid date that
Bash could become the best Pokenom trainer?
