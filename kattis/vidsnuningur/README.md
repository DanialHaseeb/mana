# [Viðsnúningur](https://open.kattis.com/problems/vidsnuningur)

Óskar is trying to learn Hebrew but he finds it hard to adjust to reading from
right to left.  In order for him to focus on the grammar he had the idea of
reversing the text so he could read left to right.  But, it would take an
inordinate amount of time to reverse the entire text.  Thus he asked you to
write a program for him that reverses text, so he can focus on learning Hebrew.

## Input

One line containing $1$ to $1\,000$ English letters and digits.

## Output

Print the line after it has been reversed so Óskar can read it.
