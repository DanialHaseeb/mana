## Acknowledgements

The exercises and solutions in this repository are curated from various popular online coding platforms, including [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com/) and [Exercism](https://exercism.org/). These platforms offer a wide array of challenges that have greatly contributed to my coding skills and problem-solving abilities.

#### Why `mana`?

The name `mana` is inspired by the popular mechanic found in many games where "mana" serves as the resource used to activate abilities and skills. Much like how a player uses mana to cast spells or use abilities, this repository represents my "mana" for codingâ€”each exercise and solution is a skill or ability in my programming repertoire.
